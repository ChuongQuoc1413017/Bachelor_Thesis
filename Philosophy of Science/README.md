+ ***Scientific Empiricism***: three sources of scientific knowledge

+ ****Observation***

		+ Public observation ought to be free

	+ Mill's Methods of Agreement and Disagreement
+ ***Experiement***
	+ Isolating and creating phenomena. Two reasons why interventions are so important:
		+ To create a phenomenon
		+ To isolate a phenomenon
	+ The scientific method:
		+ 1. Make observation
		+ 2. State problem
		+ 3. Identify variables
		+ 4. Formulate hypothesis
		+ 5. Design experiment
		+ 6. Collect data
		+ 7. Draw a conclusion
+ ***Simulation***
	+ Empirical and Reliable?

+ ***Scientific Objectivity***:
	+ Objective scientific knowledge = True knowledge
	+ Objective scientific process = Unbiased process
	+ Scientists ***aim*** to discover facts about the world through observation, experiment, and simulation
		+ ***Facts** are what is actually the case in the world
		+ ***Beliefs*** can be about anything. They can be about facts, they can be mistaken, or they can be opinions
		+ ***True beliefs*** are beliefs about facts. When we grasp the way that the world actually is, then we believe the truth
		+ => ***Beliefs change***, hopefully moving closer to the truth. But ***the facts remain the facts***
	+ ***Epistemic Values***: values that help scientists generate knowledge
		+ Accuracy
		+ Simplicity
	+ The scientific community aims to discover facts through observation, experiemnt, and simulation over time. It does this by eliminating biases through critique and the accumulation of evidence
+ ***Mechanisms of Scientific Objectivity***:
	+ ***Double-blind trials***: trials where neither the experimenters nor the participants know who's getting the real treatment for some illness and who's getting the placebo
	+ ***Randomized trials***: trial that entail trying out the drug or medical treatment on half of the experimental subjects - but which half any given person is assigned to is chosen randomly
	+ ***Controlled trials***: studies that use a control group who gets the placebo - meaning they don't get any treatment
	+ ***Theory of mind***: the ability ascribe beliefs, desires, knowledge and intentions to themselves and to others
	+ ***Peer review***: the process by which scientists critique each other's work before publication
	+ ***Pre-registration***: when a scientist submits to a journal a detailed outline of the hypotheses they want to test in a given study and the methodologies they're going to use to test those hypotheses
	+ ***Replication***: when scientists perform a study that's already been conducted to see if they get the same results
	+ ***Meta-analysis***: a statistical technique that integrates the results of many studies into one
	+ ***Priority rule***: whose publishes results first gets the credit
+ ***Shedding Bias and Approaching Truth***:
	+ Paradigm according to Thomas Kuhn
		+ While most of science was normal science, with steay accumlation of knowledge, other times involve radical shifts
	+ Helen Longino's criteria for an objective scientific process
		+ Avenues for criticism
		+ Shared standards or values
		+ Community response to criticism
		+ Intellectual authority
+ ***Failures of Objectivity***
	+ ***File drawer or trashcan problem***: since journals don't generally publish negative results, its impossible to get a real sense of the balance of evidence from the published literature
	+ ***Pre-registration***: researchers submit a detailed methodology of their experiment and their study is accepted regardless of the results
+ ***Science, Pseudoscience and Uncertainty***
	+ Confirmation bias
	+ ***Criteria of scientific status***
		+ It's easy to come up with confirmations for theories, especially when we're actively looking for them
		+ A theory that can't rule out any phenomenon isn't scientific
		+ The more a theory rules out with its predictions, the better it is
	+ Philip Stuart Kitcher's morals derived from the discovery of Neptune
		+ Scientific hypotheses need to be independently testable
		+ Science should be unified
		+ Theories should be fruitful

### 4. Week 4 Readings

		+ Url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/a-scientists-march-on-washington-is-a-bad-idea.html
+ Science in the Political Arena
+ Should Science Be Value-Free?
	+ Value-free ideal
+ Scientific Freedom and Responsibility
	+ AAAS (Advancind SCience, serving society): Scientific freedom and scientific responsibility are essential to the advancement of human knowledge for the benefit of all. Scientific freedom is the freedom to engage in scientific inquiry, pursue and apply knowledge, and communicate openly. This freeom is inextricable linked to and must be exercised in accordance with scientific responsibility. Scientific responsibility is the duty to conduct and apply science with integrity, in the interest of humanity, in a spirit of stewardship for the einvironment, and with respect for human rights
	+ ***Scientific freedom*** is the freedom to engage in scientific inquiry, pursue and apply knowledge, and communicate openly
	+ ***Scientific responsibility*** is the duty to conduct and apply science with integrity, in the interest of humanity, in a spirit of stewardship for the einvironment, and with respect for human rights
+ Cultivating Scientific Skepticism
+ ***Main ideas to take away from this course***
	+ Science is a diverse and complex enterprise
	+ Scientific empiricism
	+ Objectivity comes from the community
	+ Scientists are humans who sometimes fail
	+ Facts and values often intertwine in science
