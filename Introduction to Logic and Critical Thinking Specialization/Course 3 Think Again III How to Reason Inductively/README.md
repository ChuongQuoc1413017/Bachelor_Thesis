### 1. A New Way to Argue
+ Type of inductive arguments:
	+ Inference to the Best Explanation
	+ Arguments from Analogy
	+ Statistical Generalizations
	+ Statistical Applications
	+ Causal Reasoning
	+ Probability
	+ Decision Making
+ Deductive vs. Induction Standards
	| ***Deductive Standards*** | ***Inductive Standards***  |
	|---------------------------|----------------------------|
	| valid vs. invalid         | strong vs. weak (invalid)  |
	| all or nothing            | degrees (vary in strength) |
	| infefeasible              | defeasible                 |

### 2. Generalizations
+ ***Generalizations*** from ***samples***
	+ ***UNIVERSAL:***
		| ***Universal**                                |
		|-----------------------------------------------|
		| The first F is G.                             |
		| The second F is G.                            |
		| The rest of the Fs ***in the sample*** are G. |
		| >>> ***All*** Fs are G.                       |
	+ ***PARTIAL:***
		| ***Partial**                           |
		|----------------------------------------|
		| The first F is G.                      |
		| The second F is G.                     |
		| The third F is not G.                  |
		| The fourth F is G, and so on.          |
		| >>> X% of Fs ***in the sample are G*** |
		| >>> X% of all Fs are G.                |
	+ Questions to ask about generalizations
		+ 1 - Are the **premises** ***false*** or ***unjustified***?
		+ 2 - Is the **sample** ***too small***?
		+ 3 - Is the **sample** ***biased***?
		+ 4 - Was the **question** ***slanted***?
+ ***Applying generalizations***
	+ ***a*** = the ***individual*** to which the generalization is applied
		| Almost all F are G.          |
		|------------------------------|
		| ***a*** is F.                |
		| >>> ***a*** is (probably) G. |
	+ ***X*** = ***quantifier*** or percentage in generalization
		| ***X***% of F are G.   |
		|------------------------|
		| a is F.                |
		| >>> a is (probably) G. |
	+ Compare generalization and application
		| ***Generalization***   | ***Allication***       |
		|------------------------|------------------------|
		| X% of sampled F are G. | X% of F are G.         |
		|                        | a is F.                |
		| >>> X% of F are G.     | >>> a is (probably) G. |
	+ ***Standards*** for ***Applications***
		+ Premises must be true and justified
		+ Percentages should be very high or low
		+ No smaller reference class should conflict

### 3. Explanations and Analogies
+ ***Explanation***
	+ ***Premises***: explain the conclusion
		+ (1) When there is a leak in the roof, water drops through the roof.
		+ (2) When water comes through the roof, it drops onto whatever is in its way.
		+ (3) I am in its way.
	+ ***Conclusion***: describes the phenomenon to be explained
		+ (4) >>> Water drops onto me.
+ Inference to be ***Best Explanation***
	+ (1) Water drops onto me
	+ (2) A leak in the roof would explain why water drops onto me.
	+ (3) No better explanation is available.
	+ (4) >>> There is a leak in the roof.
+ Which explanation is the best?
	+ Process:
		+ 1 - ***Observation***: Nobody else is in the room
		+ 2 - ***Explanation***: The hypothesis that class was cancelled because of a holiday explains the observation
		+ 3 - ***Comparision***: No other hypothesis provides an explanation nearly as good as the holiday hypothesis
		+ 4 - ***Conclusion***: The holiday hypothesis in true.
	+ Other explanations:
		+ The hypothesis that the other students are late is ***falsified*** by the passing of time
		+ The hypothesis that the other students are invisible it not ***conservative***
		+ The hypothesis that the other students are undetectable is not ***fasifiable***
		+ The hypothesis that the other students are playing a joke is not ***deep***
		+ The hypothesis that the professor skipped class is not ***powerful*** or ***broad***
		+ The hypothesis that the other students are at a ceremony is not ***modest***
		+ No other hypothesis seems ***plausible***
		+ >>> No other hypothesis provides an explanation nearly as good as the holiday hypothesis
	+ The holiday hypothesis:
		+ The holiday hypothesis explains why nobody else is there
		+ The holiday hypothesis is ***broad*** because it explains other actual observations ( such as the observation that the whole building is empty)
		+ The holiday hypothesis is ***powerful*** because it applies to many seperate cases (for example, it explains why students won't be there on future holidays)
		+ The holiday hypothesis is ***falsifiable*** because the two students might find out the classes were not cancelled for the holidays
		+ The holiday hypothesis is ***not falsified*** because the two students do not actually find out that classes were not cancelled for the holiday (and for other possible ways to falsify the hypothesis)
		+ The holiday hypothesis is ***conservative*** because it does not conflict with any prior well-established beliefs
		+ The holiday hypothesis is ***deep* because it does not depend on any assumptions that need but lack independent explanation
		+ >>> The holiday hypothesis, plus accepted facts and principles, gives a strong explanation of why nobody else is in the room
+ Arguments from ***Analogy***
	+ Premises:
		+ Object A has properties P, Q, R, and so on
		+ Objects B, C, D, and so on also have properties P, Q, R, and so on
		+ Objects B, C, D, and so on also have propertiy X
	+ Conclusion:
		+ Object A (probably) also has property X
	+ with:
		+ A = the subject
		+ B, C, and D = the analogous objects
		+ P, Q, and R = the similaries
		+ X = the target
+ ***Standards of Strength***
	+ An argument from analogy is ***stronger*** when
		+ A - Thesimilarities are more important
		+ B - There are more similarities
		+ C - There are fewer disanalogies
		+ D - The analogous objects are more diverse
		+ E - The conclusion is weaker
