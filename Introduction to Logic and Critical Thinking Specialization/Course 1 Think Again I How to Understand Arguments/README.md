### 1. Definition of argument:
+ An argument is:
	+ (a) a series of sentences, statements, or propositions
	+ (b) where some are the premises
	+ (c) and one is the conclusion
	+ (d) where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion

### 2. What are arguments used for?
+ ***Persuasion:***
	+ Persuading is making people believe or do something that they would not otherwise believe or do
	+ Persuasion tries to change your belief or actions (and bad reasons can do that)
+ ***Justification:***
	+ Justifying is showing someone a reason to believe the conclusion
	+ Justification tries to give good reasons
+ ***Questions to Ask:***
	+ (1) Is the arguer trying to change someone's mind?
		+ If so, the purpose is persuasion
	+ (2) Is the arguer trying to give some kind of reason to believe something?
		+ If so, the purpose is justification
+ ***Explanations:***
	+ ***Kind of explanations*** (from Aristotle)
		+ Causal
		+ Teleological
		+ Formal
		+ Material
	+ ***An explanation in the form of an argument***: General principles or laws + Initial conditions => Phenomenon to be explained

### 3. What are arguments made of?
+ Language is: 
	+ Important
	+ Conventional
	+ Representational
	+ Social

### 4. Argument markers
+ Kinds of argument markers:
	+ ***Conclusion markers:*** so, there fore, this, accordingly, etc
	+ ***Reason markers:*** because, for, as, for the reason that, and the reason why, etc

### 5. Standard form and problems with arguments
+ Standard form:
	| (1) Premise               |
	|---------------------------|
	| (2) Premise               |
	| (3) Conclusion (from 1-2) |
+ Problem: Skeptical Regress 
	+ ***Skeptical Regress***, some suggested solutions ***(but don't work)***:
		+ 1. Start with a premise that is unjustified
		+ 2. Use an argument with a circular structure
		+ 3. Use an infinite chain of arguments 
	+ ***Tricks*** for deadling with the skeptical regress
		+ 1. Assure the audience
		+ 2. Discount objections
		+ 3. Guard your claim
+ ***Assuring***
	+ ***Kind of assuring***
		+ ***Authoritative***
			+ What is the authority?
			+ What reason does the authority have?
		+ ***Reflexive***
			+ I believe/know/am certain/feel sure that ...
		+ ***Abusive***
	+ ***Benefits of assurances***
		+ They save your time
		+ They help you avoid the skeptical regress
	+ ***Trick*** with assurances
		+ Citations of untrustworthy authorities
		+ Distractions
	+ ***Dropping assurances:*** He says/It is reported/Sources have said that ...
	+ ***We want an assurance when***
		+ Someone might question the assurance
		+ The audience accepts the authority
	+ ***Assurances are not appropriate when***
		+ No one would question the claim anyway
		+ The authority is not trustworthy
		+ When you are able to easily give the full explanation
+ ***Guarding***
	+ involves making your premises weaker so that it is harder to object to them
	+ ***Kind of guarding***
		+ ***Extent***
			+ All -> most -> many -> some
			+ Whether or not something is guarding depends on the expectation. It is guarding when you weaken a premise beyond what would otherwise be expected in the context.
		+ ***Probability***
			+ It's certain -> It's probable/likely -> There's a chance -> He might have
		+ ***Mental***
			+ Know -> believe -> tend to believe -> inclined to believe
+ ***Discounting***
	+ is citing a possible criticism in order to reject it or counter it
	+ But, although, evenif, even though, whereas, nevertheless, nonetheless, still
	+ ***But*** indicates that the sentence after it is more important than the sentence before it
	+ ***Functions of discounting terms***
		+ They assert two claims
		+ They contrast the two claims
		+ They emplasize one of the claims
	+ ***Still*** is not always a discounting term
	+ ***Trick*** of discounting straw people
		+ The arguer discounts easy objections to make people forget to think about the more difficult objections
		+ Arguers can combine the trick of discounting straw people with misuses of guarding and assuring
	+ Think about the objections that the arguer is not considering
+ ***Evaluation***
	+ When we call something "good", we don't specify what the standards are. This makes our claim more defensible since our standards cannot be questioned if they are not presented
	+ ***Defferent levels of evaluation***
		+ ***General:*** good/bad, ought/ought not, should/should not, right/wrong
		+ ***Specific:*** beautiful/ugly, cruel/kind, brave/cowardly, comfortable/uncomfortable
	+ Why are these words evaluative:
		+ What makes them evaluative is their connection to what is good or bad
		+ Words thare are contextually evaluative are not defined by "good" or "bad" and only are evaluative in certain contexts
	+ Combining positive and negatice evaluative words
		+ Good -> good
		+ Pretty good -> not as good as "good"
		+ Pretty "darn" good -> very good
	+ ***Too*** is a negative evaluative word because it makes a positive or neutral evaluative word become bad
	+ Evaluation is not always bad! Think about the standards you are applying when you make evaluations
	+ ***Slanting*** is using evaluative terms without having reasons for the evaluation

### 6. Close Analysis
+ Take a passage and mark the words in that passage that play those roles
	+ Reason marker = R
	+ Conclusion marker = C
	+ Assuring term = A
	+ Guarding term = G
	+ Discounting term = D
	+ Positive evaluative term = E+
	+ Negative evaluative term = E-

### 7. Validity and Soundness
+ ***Validity***
	+ Standards for evaluating arguments
	+ An argument is ***VALID*** if and only iff
		+ It is not possible that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false
	+ If you ***CAN*** tell a coherent story in which the ***premises are true*** and the ***conclusion is false***, then the argument is ***INVALID***
	+ If you ***CANNOT*** tell a coherent story in which the ***premises are true*** and the ***conclusion is false***, then the argument is ***VALID***
	+ ***What validity is not***
		+ A valid argument is not necessarily good
		+ Validity does not depend on whether the premises and the conclusion are actually true
	+ Validity depends on what is possible
	+ Kind of argument
		|                | True Conclusion      | False Conclusion     |
		|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
		| True Premises  | Some valid, some not | ***ALL INVALID***    |
		| False Premises | Some valid, some not | Some valid, some not |
	+ ***EVERY*** argument with true premises and a false conclusion is invalid
+ ***Soundness***
	+ In a sound argument, the conclusion ***must be true***
	+ An argument is ***SOUND*** if and only if
		+ 1. all of its premises are true, and
		+ 2. it is ***VALID***
	+ Kind of argument
		|Premises | Conclusion | Valid       | Not Valid |
		|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|
		| True    | True       | ***SOUND*** | Not sound |
		| True    | False      | Impossible  | Not sound |
		| False   | True       | Not sound   | Not sound |
		| False   | False      | Not sound   | Not sound |
	+ ***Ways an argument can be unsound***
		+ The argument is invalid
		+ It has a false premise
	+ If a deductive argument is not sound, then it is not a good argument
	+ If you know an argument is invalid, then you also know it is unsound

### 8. Reconstruction
+ The goal of reconstruction is to put an argument in a form in which we can easily and accurately assess it in as fair a manner as possible
	+ ***Stage I: Close analysis***
		+ Step 1: Do a close analysis
	+ ***Stage II: Get down to basics***
		+ Step 2: Remove all excess verbiage
		+ Step 3: List all explicit premises and conclusion in standard form
	+ ***Stage III: Sharpen edges***
		+ Step 4: Clarify where needed
		+ Step 5: Break up where possible without distortion
	+ ***Stage IV: Organize parts***
		+ Step 6: Divide the argument into sub-arguments, and arrange them in order
	+ ***Stage V: Fill in gaps***
		+ Step 7: Assess whether each argument is valid
		+ Step 8: Add suppressed premises where needed
		+ Step 9: Check each premise for truth
		+ Step 10: Qualify premises to make them true where needed if possible
	+ ***Stage VI: Assess the argument***
		+ Step 11: Conclude
			+ 11.1 If you find a sound reconstruction, accept the conclusion, since it must be true
			+ 11.2 If you try hard enough but fail to find a sound reconstruction, then it is often reasonable to conclude that the argument is not sound
