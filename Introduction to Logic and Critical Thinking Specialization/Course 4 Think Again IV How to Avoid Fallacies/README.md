### 1. Fallacies and Paradoxes of Vagueness
+ What is a fallacy?
	+ A fallacy is a knid of bad argument
	+ But not all bad arguments are fallacies
		+ Some arguments are bad because their premises are false
		+ But a ***fallacy*** is an argument that is bad because its premises ***don't support*** the conclusion, whether or not the premises are true
+ Principle of mathematical induction
+ A paradox is an argument in which all of the premises seem to be obsivously true, the argument seems to be obviously valid, and yet the conclusion seems to be obviously false
	+ Some paradoxes are fallacies, because, despite appearances, the argument is not valid
+ ***Vaguness***
	+ An expression is vague when there is ***no precise boundary*** between the cases to which it correctly applies and the cases to which it does not
	+ Examples: poor, bald, tall, tall, accomplished, famous
+ ***Why vagueness leads to paradox***
	+ If there is no precise boundary between cases of correct application and cases of incorrect application, then it will seem obviously true that a miniscule difference from a particular thing will not change whether or not we have a case of correct or incorrect application. But the problem is that a series of miniscule differences can amount to a large difference
	+ Example:
		+ Someone 1 m in height is short
		+ Someone 1 mm taller than a short person is still short
		+ ------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, someone 5 m tall is short

### 2. Slippery Slopes
+ ***Conceptual Slippery Slopes***
	+ A conceptual slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that there is no significant difference between things that belong to a category and things that do not
	+ Example:
		+ A person who owns only 1 penny is poor
		+ A difference of 1 penny is not a significant difference
		+ A person who owns 1,000,000,000,000 pennies is rich
		+ --------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ There is no significant difference between being poor and being rich
+ ***Fairness Slippery Slopes***
	+ A fairness slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that it is unfair to treat cases that fall into a category differently from cases that do not fall into that category
	+ Example:
		+ A person who scores 100% on the exam passes
		+ A difference of 0.01% is not a significant  difference
		+ -----------------------------------------------------------
		+ It is not fair to fail someone who scores a 10% on the exam
+ ***Causual Slippery Slopes***
	+ A caussal slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that a particular event will lead to a calamity that is causally connected to it by a series of steps
	+ Example:
		+ If we skip brushing our teeth tonight, then it's likely that we will skip brushing them tomorrow night 
		+ If we skip brushing our teeth tomorrow night, then it's likely that we will skip brushing them the night after tomorrow
		+ We should not skip brushing our teeth three nights in a row
		+ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, we should not skip brushing our teeth tonight

### 3. Ambiguity
+ Definition
	+ An expression is ambiguous when it has more than one acceptable interpretation
	+ Example: she is an Asian historian
		+ Interpretation 1: she is an Asian person who is also a historian
		+ Interpretation 2: she is a historian who studies about Asian history
	+ Another example:
		+ Amelia Bedelia was told to dress the chicken for dinner
		+ Amelia Bedelia could not find dinner attire small enough to fit the chicken
		+ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, Amelia Bedelia was not able to do as she was told
+ ***Semantic and Syntactic Ambiguity***
	+ ***Semantic Ambiguity***
		+ A semantic ambiguity is when a particular word has two different interpretations
		+ Example:
			+ Meredith is in a terrible state
			+ Meredith is in Texas
			+ -------------------------------
			+ Texas is a terrible state
	+ ***Syntactic Ambiguity***
		+ A syntactic ambiguity is when you have a phrase that can be given two different interpretations where the two different interpretations differ in the grammar, in what grammatical categories are assigned to different parts of the phrase
		+ Example: 
			+ Police can't stop gambling
			+ Anyone who can't stop gambling needs therapy
			+ --------------------------------------------
			+ The police need therapy
+ ***Fallacies of Equivocation***
	+ A fallacy of equivocation is a fallacy that results when an argument appears to be valid only because it switches between two different interpretations of an ambiguous expression
	+ Example:
		+ Six is an odd number of legs for a horse
		+ Odd numbers cannot be divided by two
		+ ----------------------------------------
		+ Six cannot be divided by two

### 4. Ad Hominem
+ Vagueness and ambiguity are actually usefull to ordinary language, so it is very easy to make fallacies of vagueness and ambiguity
+ ***Fallacy of relevance***
	+ A fallacy of relevance is a fallacy that results when an argument's premises are not relevant to supporting its conclusion
	+ Examples: 
		+ Ad hominem
		+ Appeal to authority
		+ Appeal to popular opnion
+ ***Fallacy of vacuity***
	+ A fallacy of vacuity is a fallacy that results when you can't be justified in accepting the premises unless you are independently justified in accepting the conclusion
	+ Examples:
		+ Circularity
		+ Begging the question
		+ Self-sealing
+ ***Ad Hominem**
	+ An Ad Hominem argument is one that begins with premises about a particular person who is making an argument, and ends with a conclusion critical of that person's argument
	+ Example:
		+ Takahashi has given an eloquent presentation of evidence that normalizing US relations with Cuba will result in benefit to both nations
		+ Takahashi owns a cigar import business, which stands to profit from normalization
		+ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ We should disregard Takahashi's presentation
	+ Three things that a person does in giving an argument
		+ (1) Implying that I am entitled to put forth claims about the issue
		+ (2) Implying that certain premses support a conclusion on the issue
		+ (3) Claiming that the conclusion is true
	+ Three kinds of ad hominem arguments
		+ Silencers
		+ Dismissers
		+ Deniers
	+ ***Silencer***
		+ begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion that we should disregard the person's argument altogether
		+ Example:
			+ I saw the accused murder the victim
			+ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
			+ Therefore, the accused is guilty of the crime with which she is charged
	+ ***Dismisser***
		+ begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion to the effect that the person's reasons are not good	
		+ Example:
			+ The fossil fuel industry is eager to operate under as little environmental regulation as possible
			+ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			+ Therefore, any reasons that the members of the fossil fuel industry give in support of the conclusion that climate change is a hoax are unlikely to provide strong support that conclusion
	+ ***Denier***
		+ begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion denying the conclusion of that person's argument
		+ Example:
			+ Arthur says "I am an inveterate liar, and most of the time I speak falsely, including now: therefore this very statement is false"
			+ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			+ Trthur's conclusion is not true

### 5. Appeals to Authority
+ ***Appeals to Authority***
	+ An appeal to authority is an argument that begins with premises about a particular person who is making a claim, and ends with a conclusion endorsing that person's claim
	+ Example:
		+ Takahashi has given an eloquent presentation of evidence that normalizing US relations with Cuba will result in benefit to both nations
		+ Takahashi's presentation was extremely eloquent, and she was very well dressed
		+ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ We should accept Takahashi's conclusion
	+ Three kinds of appeals to authority
		+ Amplifiers
		+ Supporters
		+ Affirmers
+ ***Amplifier***
	+ begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion that we should place great weight on the person's point
	+ Example:
		+ The speaker teaches a class on media and popular culture at Columbia University
		+ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, we should lend great credence to the speaker's view on the issues of which he speaks
+ ***Supporter***
	+ begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion to the effect that the person's reasons are especially compelling
	+ Example:
		+ Warren Buffet has argued that confidence in the dollar will rise, and therefore the price of gold will soon fall
		+ When Warren Buffet speaks, investors listen and believe
		+ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, confidence in the dollar will probably rise
+ ***Affirmer***
	+ begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion affirming that person's point
	+ Example:
		+ Warren Buffet has argued that confidence in the dollar will rise, and therefore the price of gold will soon fall
		+ When Warren Buffet speaks, investors listen and believe
		+ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, the price of gold will soon fall
+ ***Apeals to Popular Opnition***
	+ An appeal to popular opinion is an argument that begins with premises about the popularity of a particular claim, and ends with a conclusion endorsing that claim
	+ Example:
		+ Many people think that the verb "to emulate" is a synonym of "to imitate"
		+ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, at least one of the meanings of the verb "to emulate" is the same as "to imitate"

### 6. Vacuity
+ A ***fallacy of vacuity*** is a fallacy that results when an argument starts by assuming what it's supposed to establish
+ Kinds of fallacies of vacuity
	+ Circularity
	+ Begging the question
	+ Self-sealing
+ ***Circularity***
	+ when the conclusion of an argument is among the premises
	+ Example:
		+ This argument has a premise
		+ This argument has a conclusion
		+ -----------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, this argument has a conclusion
+ ***Begging the question***
	+ when you cannot have a reason to believe an argument's the premises unless you have an independent reason to believe its conclusion
	+ Example:
		+ The pope says that he is infallible
		+ Whatever the Pope says is always right
		+ --------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, the Pope is infallible
+ ***Self-sealers***
	+ A self-sealer is a proposition or argument that is irrefutable because it does not claim anything, it does not rule out any conceivable situation
	+ Example: "All human action is selfish"
		+ Apparent counterexample: self-sacrificing heroism
		+ Rebuttal: heroism is motivated by desire to be a hero
	+ Most self-sealing arguments are simply arguments that contain self-sealing propositions

### 7. Refutation
+ To refute an argument is to show that the argument is unsucessful
+ An argument may be unsucessful because we are not entitled to accept its premises, or it may be unsucessful because its premises do not support its conclusion
+ The varieties of refutation
	+ To refute an argument is thus to show that its premises do not support its conclusion, or that we are not entitled do accept its premises
	+ We can do the former using refutation by parallel reasoning
	+ We can do the latter using counterexamples or reductio ad absurdum
+ The pitfalls of refutation
	+ In attempting to refute an argument, we may end up attacking a straw man, or replying upon a false dichotomy
+ ***Refutation by Parallel Reasoning***
	+ To refute an argument by parallel reasoning is to show that the argument's form is not valid or strong
	+ What's crucial in refutation by paralel reasoning is 
		+ You have to make sure that the parallel argument that you are using to refute the original argument, that the parallel argument has exactly the same form as the original argument
		+ The parallel argument is clearly a fallacy
	+ Example:
		+ Original
			+ If I had a higher salary, I could buy a bigger house
			+ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			+ Therefore, if everyone had a higher salary, everyone could buy a bigger house
		+ Parallel
			+ If one person stands up at a ball game, then she will get a better view
			+ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			+ therefore, if everyone stands up at a ball game, then everyone will get a better view
+ ***False Dichotomy***
	+ An argument relies upon a false dichotomy when it falsely assumes that there are only two possible situation
	+ Example:
		+ Either other nations are with us, or they are against us, in our war gainst terrorism
		+ Switzerland is not with us
		+ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Switzerland is against us
+ ***Reductio Ad Absurdum***
	+ A reductio ad absurdum is an argument that proves that a particular hypothesis is false, because it implies an absurdity
	+ Example:
		+ If you count long enough, you will eventually run out of numbers to count
		+ -------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, counting is an activity that cannot go on forever
+ ***Counterexamples***
	+ A couunterexample is an example that runs counter to a generaluzation: it thereby shows that the generalization is false
	+ Counterexamples can be used to refute arguments that contain generalizations in either their premises or their conclusions
	+ Example:
		+ Breaking the law is almost wrong (how about an emergency?)
		+ Double parking is breaking the law
		+ ----------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, double parking is almost always wrong
+ ***Attacking a Straw Man***
	+ You attack a straw man when you misunderstood the argument or hypothesis that you are attempting to refute
	+ Example:
		+ Me: we should distribute condoms to teenagers around the world, in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies and all the tragic costs that result from them
		+ You: oh, so you must want to encourage teenagers to have as much sex as possible
