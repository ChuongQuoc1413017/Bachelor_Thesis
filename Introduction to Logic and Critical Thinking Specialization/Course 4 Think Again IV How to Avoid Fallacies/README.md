### 1. Fallacies and Paradoxes of Vagueness
+ What is a fallacy?
	+ A fallacy is a knid of bad argument
	+ But not all bad arguments are fallacies
		+ Some arguments are bad because their premises are false
		+ But a ***fallacy*** is an argument that is bad because its premises ***don't support*** the conclusion, whether or not the premises are true
+ Principle of mathematical induction
+ A paradox is an argument in which all of the premises seem to be obsivously true, the argument seems to be obviously valid, and yet the conclusion seems to be obviously false
	+ Some paradoxes are fallacies, because, despite appearances, the argument is not valid
+ ***Vaguness***
	+ An expression is vague when there is ***no precise boundary*** between the cases to which it correctly applies and the cases to which it does not
	+ Examples: poor, bald, tall, tall, accomplished, famous
+ ***Why vagueness leads to paradox***
	+ If there is no precise boundary between cases of correct application and cases of incorrect application, then it will seem obviously true that a miniscule difference from a particular thing will not change whether or not we have a case of correct or incorrect application. But the problem is that a series of miniscule differences can amount to a large difference
	+ Example:
		+ Someone 1 m in height is short
		+ Someone 1 mm taller than a short person is still short
		+ ------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, someone 5 m tall is short

### 2. Slippery Slopes
+ ***Conceptual Slippery Slopes***
	+ A conceptual slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that there is no significant difference between things that belong to a category and things that do not
	+ Example:
		+ A person who owns only 1 penny is poor
		+ A difference of 1 penny is not a significant difference
		+ A person who owns 1,000,000,000,000 pennies is rich
		+ --------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ There is no significant difference between being poor and being rich
+ ***Fairness Slippery Slopes***
	+ A fairness slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that it is unfair to treat cases that fall into a category differently from cases that do not fall into that category
	+ Example:
		+ A person who scores 100% on the exam passes
		+ A difference of 0.01% is not a significant  difference
		+ -----------------------------------------------------------
		+ It is not fair to fail someone who scores a 10% on the exam
+ ***Causual Slippery Slopes***
	+ A caussal slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that a particular event will lead to a calamity that is causally connected to it by a series of steps
	+ Example:
		+ If we skip brushing our teeth tonight, then it's likely that we will skip brushing them tomorrow night 
		+ If we skip brushing our teeth tomorrow night, then it's likely that we will skip brushing them the night after tomorrow
		+ We should not skip brushing our teeth three nights in a row
		+ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, we should not skip brushing our teeth tonight

### 3. Ambiguity
+ Definition
	+ An expression is ambiguous when it has more than one acceptable interpretation
	+ Example: she is an Asian historian
		+ Interpretation 1: she is an Asian person who is also a historian
		+ Interpretation 2: she is a historian who studies about Asian history
	+ Another example:
		+ Amelia Bedelia was told to dress the chicken for dinner
		+ Amelia Bedelia could not find dinner attire small enough to fit the chicken
		+ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		+ Therefore, Amelia Bedelia was not able to do as she was told
+ ***Semantic and Syntactic Ambiguity***
	+ ***Semantic Ambiguity***
		+ A semantic ambiguity is when a particular word has two different interpretations
		+ Example:
			+ Meredith is in a terrible state
			+ Meredith is in Texas
			+ -------------------------------
			+ Texas is a terrible state
	+ ***Syntactic Ambiguity***
		+ A syntactic ambiguity is when you have a phrase that can be given two different interpretations where the two different interpretations differ in the grammar, in what grammatical categories are assigned to different parts of the phrase
		+ Example: 
			+ Police can't stop gambling
			+ Anyone who can't stop gambling needs therapy
			+ --------------------------------------------
			+ The police need therapy
+ ***Fallacies of Equivocation***
	+ A fallacy of equivocation is a fallacy that results when an argument appears to be valid only because it switches between two different interpretations of an ambiguous expression
	+ Example:
		+ Six is an odd number of legs for a horse
		+ Odd numbers cannot be divided by two
		+ ----------------------------------------
		+ Six cannot be divided by two
