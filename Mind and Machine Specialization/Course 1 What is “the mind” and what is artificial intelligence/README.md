### 1. The Lure and Eeriness of Machine Life
+ A few parting thoughts...
	+ Machines that imitate humans (artificial intelligence)
	+ Modeling humans as machines (the "computational metaphor of mind" in cognitive science)
	+ Finding other "middle grounds" between machines and minds

### 2. Alan Turing's Test
+ The Turing test (Q: question, A: answer)
	+ Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge
	+ A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry
	+ Q: Add 34957 to 70764
	+ A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621
	+ Q: Do you play chess?
	+ A: Yes
	+ Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
	+ A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate
	+ => Is Q a person or a computer?
+ Potential objections provided by Turing
	+ The Theological Objection
	+ The "Heads in the Sand" Objection
	+ The Mathematical Objection
	+ The Argument from Consciousness
	+ Arguments from Various Disabilities
	+ Lady Lovelace's Objection
	+ Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System
	+ The Argument from Informality of Behavior
	+ The Argument from ESP
+ Searle's "Chinese Room"
	+ The Systems Reply
	+ The Robot Reply
	+ The Brain-Simulator Reply
	+ The Combination reply
	+ The Other-Minds Reply
	+ The Many-Mansions Reply

### 3. The Computational Metaphor of Mind
+ The Minds is (Like?) a Computer
	+ A response to the (then-) reigning behaviorist tradition in American psychology
+ Suppose we take the following metaphor seriously:
	+ ***Software is to hardware as mind is to brain***
	+ We don't have to explain mind at the level of neuroscience
	+ Mental representations (parse trees, symbols, rules, images) are as "real", and as worthy of study, as (say) algorithms in the realm of computer science
+ ***Functionalism*** is generally summarized as the notion that mental states are characterized according to their causal roles in a system of mental states. In particular, it doesn't matter in what physical substance these states happen to be embodied. There is a resonance here with the notion of a computer program: it doesn't matter whether that program happens to be rewritten for a Macintosh or Cray or whatever--the essential program remains the same

### 4. What Makes a Problem Hard
+ ***Type 1***: From some problems, we hardly know where to begin. They may be impossible for reasons we don't yet know; or perhaps they are not well-defined
	+ Examples:
		+ Write a program that will pass the Turing Test
		+ Define (and teach) virtue (Plate's Meno)
		+ Exaplain the meaning of life
+ ***Type 2***: Some well-defined problems are known to be impossible. These represent intellectual landmarks for human thought
	+ Examples:
		+ Using a straightedge and compass, and given an angle theta, cosntruct an angle of magnitude theta/3 
		+ Write a program which, given any computer program P and nubmer N as input, determines whether P will ever halt when run on input N (Turing)
+ ***Some problems incorporate uncertainty, probability, or vagueness***
	+ Examples:
		+ Was there life on Mars at some past time?
		+ If I have to place a bet on a future event (e.g., whether the Red Sox will win the pennant this year), how should I bet?
		+ Is this object (person, animal) a threat?
		+ Is this shape: 0 an ellipse? Is it "close" to an ellipse?
+ ***Some problems may be impossible to solve with complete accuracy, but they can be approached by using approximations, guesswork, or heuristics. What this means is that perhaps all the "solutions" will be wrong (and we try to make most of the solutions as "right" as possible); or it might mean that some solutions, but not all, will be right***
	+ Examples:
		+ Given a two-dimensional scene projected on a retina or camera plane, deduce the three-dimensional scene (set of objects) that produced this two-dimensional projection
		+ Given a finite set of sentences, determine the formal structure of a context-free grammar that generated those
+ ***Some problems--fortunately--are "easy" in the sense that we can write a program to solve them, and the program will typically run in a reasonable time***
	+ Examples:
		+ Given a positive number, find its square root
		+ Given a context-free grammar G, produce a sentence using that grammar
		+ Given 100 linear equations in 100 variables, determine whether those equations have a solution, and if so, what it is
+ ***Order-of-Growth***
	+ The basic idea: when a praticular type of problem "becoms large-scale", how much more time will it take to solve?
+ ***Computational Notions of "Hardness" of Problems***
	+ Order-of-growth notation: how does a problem's difficulty "scale up" to the large cases?
	+ Polynomial vs. exponential-time problems
	+ NP-Complete problems
	+ Parallelism as a general straategy
+ So where does all this leave us?
	+ There are many distinct and sometimes subtle ways in which a problem can be "hard" or "easy"
	+ Some problems that we find "easy", such as vision or learning our native language, prove to be surprisingly hard to understand and program
	+ Getting a machine to solve a problem is one way of illuminating the "difficulty" (perhaps, in some cases, the profundity) of the problem
